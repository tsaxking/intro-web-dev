// Create a flash card class
    // Create a constructor that takes in a question and an answer
        // Set this.question to the question and do the same thing for the answer
        // It may also be useful to store which side the flash card is on
    // Create a method that will flip the flash card and then log the new value
        // Check which side the card is on and log the question or answer based off that

        // Change which side it thinks it on

// You can use a index variable to track where in the array you are selecting
// Create an array of instances of the FlashCard class


// Create an interval (you may want to store the interval's id so you can clear it later)
    // Check if the index is still valid (is it less then the array length)
        // if it isn't you could either clear the interval or reset the index

    // you can use a variable to store which flash card you are currently displaying

    // You can maybe use a method from earlier to log the flash card's value and/or flip it
    // Then you can use a timeout to delay when the flash card will be flipped
        // Then you can use the same or a different method to log the card's value again
            // Finally you might want to add some sort of space or divider between each card to make it easy to read

    // Edit the index
