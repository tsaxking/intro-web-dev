// Create two point objects that have an x, y, and a z
// Create a function that lets you add the points by adding the xs together then ys together etc
// Create a function that lets you multiply a point by a number by multiplying x, y, and z by that number
// Create a subtraction number that works the same way as the addition but for subtraction
// Create a division function just like the multiplication one
// Try to defined the subtraction and division functions using the addition and multiplication functions
// Create 4 new points that are the output of those functions
// Log all 4 points and check that they are correct
