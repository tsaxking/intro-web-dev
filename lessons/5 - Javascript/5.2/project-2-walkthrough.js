// Create a function that takes in the parameters a, b, and c.

    // Create a for loop that will initialize sign as -1,
    // increase sign so that it is +1,
    // and end when sign is no longer -1 or 1

        // Within the loop you can just do the normal quadratic formula
        // Note that you may want to split up some of the formula into multiple variables like the numerator and denominator
        // To make your code look better

        // Also instead of doing + or - Math.sqrt() you can do + sign * Math.sqrt()
        // Because of the for loop

        // Log the result

// Set your own a, b, and c variables

// plug them into the function

// You can check whether they are valid using desmos
