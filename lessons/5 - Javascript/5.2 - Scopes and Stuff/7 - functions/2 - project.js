// The objective of this project is to build a graphing calculator 
// like the one linked in project-example.png
// You can do this by creating a function f that is an actual mathematical function
// THere are then many different ways to do this
// The simplest way is to just have a draw(x) function that will output a row of the graph to the command line for each x
// Then you can just use a for loop to draw every x
// However, this has the side effect of the graph being sideways
// If you are already familiar with JS/coding and know how arrays work you can probably find a way to do this but not sideways
// But if you aren't familiar with JS, it's fine if the graph isn't oriented the traditional way
