// For this project we will be building a spam bot
// We want to have a message be sent every 5 seconds
// However, we also want to make the time between each
// message to be random so that it is harder to detect that we are spamming
// We can do this by sending a message between each of the actual messages that makes the actual time between messages random
// Have the bot log the time since the last message
