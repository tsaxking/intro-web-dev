// Create a new function that generates 
// a doubled array that is just filled with blank strings
    // You can use new Array(length) to create an array of a certain length
    // You can then use fill to fill the array with a value
    // (Note that in order to use map you have to fill an array for some reason)
    // Also, note that filling arrays can be goofy because of dependencies


// Create a function that will take in a doubled array,
// combine it and then log the combined array
// You can use console.clear() in order to remove the previous drawings

/*
    Create a function named animate that 
    will take in an array of { 
        x: number,
        y: number
    } objects

    Then use set interval to loop through the array 
    and call your draw function from earlier on a blank doubled array that has been edited
*/
    // You can use a variable to store where you are within the array 

    // Then you can use setInterval to draw things each frame
        // You can use the first function you created to generate
        // A blank doubled array

        // Then you can take a coordinate from the coordinate array
        // You can edit a certain place (based of the coordinate) in the array
        // and change that place's value to "O" or some other string

        // Finally you can call your draw function on the doubled array to log it

        // Also remember to increment your variable 
        // that is storing where you are in the array

/* 
    Create an array of coordinates in the form:
        { 
            x: number,
            y: number
        }
*/

// Then call your animate function on the array!
