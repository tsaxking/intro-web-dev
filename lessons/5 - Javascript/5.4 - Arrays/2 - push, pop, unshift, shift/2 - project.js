// Create two arrays
// Loop through the numbers from 0-9 and randomly put them in one of the arrays
// Log these new random arrays
// Then randomly pop or shift an item from one array and then push or unshift it to the other array
// Log the new arrays and the moved item
// Then write a function that will check whether one of the arrays is sorted from lowest to highest
// Use an interval to repeatedly move an item from one array to another until one of the arrays has all the elements and is sorted
// While this sorting algorithm may seem like absolute garbage (because it is), if your run it enough times it will eventually be very efficient
// My fastest time with this algorithm is 0.009 seconds lol
