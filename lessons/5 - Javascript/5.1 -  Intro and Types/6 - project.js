// Part 1 - strings
// Create two variables that are strings
// Then add the two strings together and lot the result
// See how many ways you can add the string together (there should be at least 2-3)

// Part 2 - numbers
// Create a program that uses Math.random() to create a couple 
// random numbers and store them in variables
// Math.random will return a random number between 0-1
// Log those numbers and then multiply, add, subtract, and divide them from each other and log the result
// You can google up the documentation for JavaScript's Math online to see what other operations you can perform

// Part 3 - booleans
// Create two boolean variables
// log what they are when you combine them with an && gate and an || gate
// Change whether the boolean variables are true or false and predict what will be logged
