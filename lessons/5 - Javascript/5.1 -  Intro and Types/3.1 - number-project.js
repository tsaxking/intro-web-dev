// Create a program that uses Math.random() to create a couple 
// random numbers and store them in variables
// Math.random will return a random number between 0-1
// Log those numbers and then multiply, add, subtract, and divide them from each other and log the result
// You can google up the documentation for JavaScript's Math online to see what other operations you can perform
