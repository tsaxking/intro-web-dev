# FIRST Robotics
## What is FIRST?
FIRST = For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology. This is a nonprofit organization started by Dean Kamen, the inventor of the Segway. FIRST is a robotics competition that is designed to inspire students to pursue careers in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). FIRST is a worldwide competition with over 20,000 teams and 85,000 students. FIRST is split into 4 different programs: FLL Jr., FLL, FTC, and FRC. FLL Jr. is for students in grades K-4, FLL is for students in grades 4-8, FTC is for students in grades 7-12, and FRC is for students in grades 9-12.

## What is FRC?
FIRST Robotics Competition is a level of FIRST for high school students. In FRC, teams of students are given a challenge to build a robot to complete a task in roughly 2.5 minutes. The challenge changes every year, so teams must adapt to the new challenge. Teams are given 6 weeks to build their robot, and then they compete in regional competitions. The top teams from the regional competitions go to the World Championship.

## What am I getting myself into?
FRC is a huge commitment. It is a lot of work, but it is also a lot of fun. You will learn a lot about engineering, programming, and teamwork. You will learn how to work with others, how to manage your time, and how to solve problems. FRC is a great experience, and you get out of it what you put into it.
