# What is Team Tators?
Team Tators, or Team 2122, is a FIRST Robotics Competition team based in Boise, Idaho. We are a team of high school students from all over the Treasure Valley. We are mentored by engineers from Micron, HP, and other local companies. We are a very close team, and we have a lot of fun together.

## What am I getting myself into?
Similar to what was said about FRC, you get out what you put in. Students of all skill levels are welcome, and we will teach you everything you need to know. We have a lot of fun, and we learn a lot. We are a very close team, and we are always looking for new members.

## How much time will I have to commit?
During the season, we meet from 6pm to midnight every weekday, then 1pm to midnight on Saturdays and Sundays. New students are encouraged to come for 1 or two meetings a week, and "veteran" students who have high priority tasks are needed in the shop almost daily. Not every student needs to be there the whole time, but let's be honest, you'll want to be there the whole time ;)
