# Organization
Organizing your files and code is important. It makes it easier to find what you're looking for and makes it easier to work with others.

## File structure
A file structure is a way of organizing files and folders. There are many different ways to organize files and folders, but there are some common practices that are used by many people.

### Repositories/Projects method
I personally would recommend you keep all your repositories and projects in one folder. This makes it easier to find them and makes it easier to back them up.

For example, I keep all my repositories and projects in `C:\Users\Taylor\Documents\Programming`.

### Language method
Another way to organize your files and folders is by language. This is useful if you work with many different languages.

For example, you could have a folder for each language you use, and then a folder for each project in that language.

### Subject method
Another way to organize your files and folders is by subject. This is useful if you have multiple repositories and projects for multiple groups.

For example, you could have a folder for school, personal, and work, and then a folder for each project/repository in each of those folders.
