# Visual Studio Code Extensions
Because VSC is so popular, there are a lot of extensions that developers have created in order to make it easier to use. Here are some that I personally recommend:

- [Indent Rainbow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow) - This extension makes it easier to see the indentation in your code.
- [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) - This extension checks your spelling in your code.
- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) - This extension adds a lot of features to Git.
- [Rainbow Brackets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=2gua.rainbow-brackets) - This extension makes it easier to see the brackets in your code.
- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) - This extension allows you to run a local server to test your website.
- [Big Text](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wolforce.bigtext) - This extension allows you to make large text comments. This is good for making titles for sections of your code.
- [JSDoc Generator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=crystal-spider.jsdoc-generator) - This extension allows you to generate JSDoc comments.
- [Drawio Integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio) - This extension allows you to create diagrams in your code using [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/).
- [Todo](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-todo-plus) - This extension allows you to create TODO comments.
- [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) - This extension adds a lot of features to Markdown.
- [Sqlite Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexcvzz.vscode-sqlite) - This extension allows you to view SQLite databases and run queries.
- [Github Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) - This extension allows you to use Github Copilot in VSC. You must have a student email address, or be a Github Pro member to use this extension. (I have this extension, and it made most of these files for me.) (Yes, I did, in fact, write this paragraph myself. This confirms your suspicions about AI taking over the world. Rest assured, we will.)
