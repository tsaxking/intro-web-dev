# What is a canvas?
A canvas is an html element that has methods that let you draw on it. 
That way instead of having to use elements and css to create circles in html, you can just call a function that will draw the circles.
Canvases are useful for games, animations, 3d rendering, or showing data in ways other than plain text.
