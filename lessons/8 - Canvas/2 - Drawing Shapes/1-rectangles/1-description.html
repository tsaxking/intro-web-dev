<!-- For this project you will be creating a website that lets you configure and create your own rectangles -->
<!-- Use the column system to split the screen between a canvas and a set of sliders -->
<!-- Make a bunch of sliders/inputs that let you change things like the width, height, color, and position of the rectangle -->
<!-- The use event listeners to update the rectangle when the sliders change -->
