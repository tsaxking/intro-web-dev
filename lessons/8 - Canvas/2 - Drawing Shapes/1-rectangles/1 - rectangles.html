        // Firstly, in order to do anything with the canvas we have to get the canvas's "context"
        // We can do this by doing canvas.getContext('2d') because we are just going to be doing 3d things
        const context = canvas.getContext("2d");

        // Now, if we want to make the rectangles a certain color, we have to set either the fillStyle or strokeStyle
        // StrokeStyle determines the color of lines so if you are doing a rectangle outline then you would use strokeStyle
        // FillStyle is the inside of shapes so if you are doing a filled rectangle then you would use fillStyle
        context.strokeStyle = "rgb(125, 125, 125)"; //Grey
        context.fillStyle = "rgba(200, 10, 10, 0.5)"; // Red (Transparent so you can see where the stroke and fill overlap)

        // Additionally by setting the lineWidth we can change how many pixels thick the outline is
        context.lineWidth = 10;

        // You can then draw the outside of the rect using canvas.strokeRect(x, y, width, height)
        // These rectangles should be grey because thats what we set the strokeStyle to earlier
        context.strokeRect(10, 10, 100, 100);

        // To do filledRects use fillRect
        // These rectangles should be red because of the fillStyle earlier
        context.fillRect(10, 10, 100, 100);

        // You can also do
        context.rect(160, 10, 100, 100);
        context.fill();

        // You can also remove stuff from the canvas using clearRect
        context.clearRect(160, 10, 50, 50); // This will remove a chunk of the rectangle from before
        // You can clear the entire canvas by doing: (it's commented out because right now we don't want to clear the canvas)
        // const { width, height } = canvas;
        // context.clearRect(0, 0, width, height);
